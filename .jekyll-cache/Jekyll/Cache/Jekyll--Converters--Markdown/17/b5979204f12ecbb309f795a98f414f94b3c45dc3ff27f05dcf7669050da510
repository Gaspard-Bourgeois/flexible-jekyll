I"½<p>During my first and second year in ENSAM, I joined the informatics studentsâ€™ union, a team of 3 students in charge of maintaining the wifi infrastructure and making some informatics projects. At that time, former students have made an offline website called Vanadium to manage all the payments inside the promotions, those payments include money exchange between all students and other studentsâ€™ union. The website was written mainly in both PHP Oriented Object and Javascript, transactions were saved on a local server accessed through SQL queries. At this time, the platform was used to save all the account balances in one place, the fiduciary money was handled by the leading studentsâ€™ union, creating and deleting money on the platform. We engaged with our promotion to put this useful platform online.</p>

<p>The website is only accessible by members of ENSAM with an account at <a href="http://myvanadium.com">http://myvanadium.com</a>. Thatâ€™s why I will present some pictures of the website in this page only. The task done by our team is presented, followed by a quick overview of the website for a better understanding.</p>

<h1 id="define-the-needs">Define the needs</h1>

<p>With the leading studentsâ€™ union, we planned several tasks to completely transform this platform, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Migrate the platform online</li>
  <li>Enable some secured banking card top up on the platform</li>
  <li>Notify regularly by email members in bankrupt</li>
  <li>Get some statistics on expenses</li>
  <li>Improve the global design</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="organize-and-schedule-tasks">Organize and schedule tasks</h1>

<p>Main goal was to have the platform working with card payment methods online before our second year in school. In fact, the platform was stopped on holidays only. We fixed to weeks during holidays to achieve it together. All the other tasks were to be done all along the year.</p>

<p>Tasks done between first and second-year holidays in ENSAM by the informantâ€™s studentsâ€™ union.</p>

<h2 id="migrate-the-platform-online">Migrate the platform online</h2>

<p>We subscribed to an online host server and we bought a domain name server. We migrated both files and database. We performed several tests to ensure the integrity of data. We optimized the size of pictures to accelerate navigation.</p>

<h2 id="enable-the-secured-banking">Enable the secured banking</h2>

<p>Thanks to a partnership between school and Lydia, we could pay through Lydia payment platform. They were really few information on the procedure to follow in the web. We took contact with an informatics employee of Lydia to make our solution of payment secured.</p>

<h1 id="second-year-work">Second-year work</h1>

<p>Task done by the informatics union on Vanadium all along our second year in ENSAM.</p>

<h2 id="notify-members-by-email">Notify members by email</h2>

<p>We defined a list of automatic messages for different profile cases. Some of them aimed at preventing bankrupt, some other at giving information about the account status. To perform regular tasks on a server, it is common to use CRON, unfortunately our server didnâ€™t allow it.
The idea was to perform the task on page loads. During every connection, hidden to them members check whether or not they are some emails left to send. Mails are sent after the page load to keep unchanged the user experience.</p>

<h2 id="enhance-statistics-on-expense">Enhance statistics on expense</h2>

<p>We wanted students to access the total money spent on the site, to have an evolution of expenses view, and to know how expenses were divided between each studentsâ€™ union.
An overview of the page in use is accessible <a href="#statistics">down there</a>.</p>
