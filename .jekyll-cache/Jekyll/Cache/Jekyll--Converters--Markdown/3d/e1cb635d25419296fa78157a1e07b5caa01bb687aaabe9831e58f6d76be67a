<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Electromagnetic communications are everywhere, in phones, gps, magnetic cards. They are now gradually integrating the medical field, with for example the monitoring of wireless pacemakers. Iâ€™m interested about those technologies of data exchange. Thatâ€™s why I decided to reproduce an industrial device for remote communication at my scale.</p>

<h1 id="to-structure-my-project">To structure my project</h1>
<p>In order to start my project on solid basis, the 22th of December 2015, I visited a company specialised on pacemaker, called LivaNova (92). I met Renzo DAL MOLIN, the Director of Advanced Research in Livanova, he made me visit his company, and gave a lot of advice on how to imagine my system. He proposed to do a binary exchange thanks to Arduino tension. I really appreciated his help.
Then I went to the famous engineering school called Supelec in order to meet Anthony KOLAR, Teacher-Researcher at Centrale-SupÃ©lec, specialized in the design of integrated systems with high constraints applications in medical systems. Antony is brilliant and exactly the person I needed on my project. We worked together an afternoon in order to conceive the basis of my electronic system, explained after.</p>

<h1 id="my-personal-work">My personal work</h1>
<p>My work was organised around 3 parts :</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to conceive a wireless system on my own with the school materials I had.
I conceived a system, transforming a binary tension (5V/0V) to a magnetic signal. It represented my central. And then I conceived another system, reading that magnetic signal and converting it to a binary tension interpreted after by a computer. It represented the pacemaker. All of it constituted a wireless system communicating through wireless magnetic waves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to create an optimised protocol of communication between both devices
I took a number and converted it into a binary signal with an Arduino. Then I changed the length of the signal and the number of repetitions of the sequence, I analysed the good interpretation of the signal by another Arduino and also the time it took to transmit the number. I added a checksum in the binary signal to improve the communication.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to quantify the influence of the environment on the device range.
I put an equivalent system in different environments, including one imitating the pacemakerâ€™s one.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
