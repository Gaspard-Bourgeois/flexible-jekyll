This project was to conceive and build two trophies and 420 medals for different events.
One trophy was ordered by Neoma Business School for a sports tournament called Ecricome. The second trophy and the 420 medals were aimed to reward the students of our school for a sports tournament called UAI 2018 organized by our student organization.

An independent project team was created by the school to manage this project. A total of XXX working hours were allocated by the school along the year.

We established some strong relationships with our customer Neoma and our school. This project is covered by a written report and a speech.

Our partnership with Neoma was supported by our school. This project was celebrated by publishing an article into the school news.

# Make trophies

## Meet Néoma and define a trophy
We met M.Brahmi, the president of Neoma Sports Student Union Committee, and his team the 14th of December 2017.
They defined their needs and the timeline, aimed at finishing the trophy before their tournament on March 2018.

We decided to conceive similar features for both NEOMA and ENSAM trophies.

## Design it in Catia
After several technical verifications, reviews and prototypes, we agreed on a final version of the CAD with our client.

## Realize trophies

The realization had four steps:
- machine the wood block
- punch the metal
- engrave the plastic slab
- flow the resin

### Wooden part

We transferred the CAD shape to a milling machine using StratoConception© process.

We made a prototype for the final validation regarding its size, its resistance, its milling time and so on.

We updated our CAD and made the final version of the wooden part of the trophies.

### Brass Plate

We used a press machine to model the brass plate shape. This machine, called Aries 222, is complex to program, so we decided a single text for both trophies.
Every letter was programed with adapted punches and trajectories.
For the Ensam trophy, we switched brass for aluminum to lower the material cost.

### Plastic Slab

We transformed both school logos to shape. We engraved the anthracite plastic in the laser engraver named V2000.

### The resin

We mixed epoxy resin and a hardener to try our first resin with a sample.

Thanks to the sample, we updated the temperature and the hardening time. To do so, we let the trophy with the resin in an oven.

### Final Step

We varnished both trophies, then we pasted every part together.

# Make medals

## Design the medals

We designed the aesthetics of the medals with the organizing team. The size of the medals and the precision of the lines were fixed by the press machine. The aluminum was nice for the machine capacity and his low cost.

## Make the stamps

### Chose the stamp material

We bought some Iron 90MV8, a matter with good hardness and tenacity skills to punch aluminum. We machined the stamps to fit in the press machine, one stamp for each side.

### Computer Assisted Manufacturing

We modelized the process to machine the stamps.

### Mill the stamp

We launched the manufacturing with the adapted milling cutters.

### Heat the Stamp

To give the stamps the adapted hardness, we heat treated them. We did a quenching treatment first at 780°C for 30 minutes, followed by a tempering one at 220°C of 1 hour.

## Stamp medals

We punched 500 medals in aluminum with a press of 220T.

## Finalize medals

We colored our medals with an anodizing process in a local company named Anodur. Then we pierced medals and added a choker.
