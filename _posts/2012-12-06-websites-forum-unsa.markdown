In my last year of High School I wrote a website for my class in order to exchange information altogether. It was used to ask question, to exchange on works or just chill together.

In order to make this website I learned MySQL, PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS. The website was fully handwritten by myself, and hosted in a personal server for one year.

# Website codes

You can access all of my work directly on my github repository:
[https://github.com/Gaspard-Bourgeois/Forum-UNSA](https://github.com/Gaspard-Bourgeois/Forum-UNSA)

Follow the tutorial in order to build the website locally. Feel free to send me any feedback or any updates in order to improve the website.

# Website Preview

I gathered some screenshot of the website below. I will give further details on functionalities in a next update.
