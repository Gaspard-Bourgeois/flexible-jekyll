With a team made out of 2 friends we recently started to work on a project called Ironcar.

# Objectives

We have to build a fully autonomous RC vehicle. The RC vehicle will be initially radio commanded. Then it will use a camera, a Raspberry Pi and a memory to find the path on its own.
In order to perform this task, the vehicle will analyze pictures thanks to machine learning and make the right choices.

# Working team

Our team is composed of three former classmates :
- Benoit Boyeau
- Mathieu Bouvet
- Gaspard Bourgeois

We all studied robotics but not in the same place.

# Our works

We are currently analyzing the project of the previous teams.

All of our works are gathered under this github link:
