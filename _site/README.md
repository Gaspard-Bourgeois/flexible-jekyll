This repository contains all the files of my portfolio accessible at [http://gaspard-bourgeois.github.io](http://gaspard-bourgeois.github.io). You can discover detailed articles describing some of my experiences.

My portfolio is designed under Jekyll. I adapted my website from an online template. Then, I completely changed the menu design.
